This is PHP Code based on the CAKE PHP Framework.

If you ever used DOI Metadata you might know how hard it is to handle all those XML values and dependecies. I took the relevant DOI Data fields for Web objects, and created a XML -> MYSQL mapping in order to store DOI Metadata in a relational database. The code you can download here is a complete Content Management System, an XML creation tool, as well as a repository for normal users to browse the DOI information of your registered Codes.

The MySQL Dabase schema will be offered on github in a separate section under my username.

The "Digital Object Identifier" System is an international standard to add metadata to works. There a many data fields for each DOI record, which have to be assembled into a valid XML file for upload to the Registration Agency. In order to create, view, filter and sort the DOI Codes for an online literature magazine, we prorammed this Web-CMS. It serves the following separate functions:
1) Enter DOI Metadata for a specific web document (ADMIN Mode)
2) Create a valid XML file for deployment to the RA (ADMIN Mode)
3) Make the Database of DOI Codes and Metadata browsable for normal Users
4) Offer a REST API to harvest our DOI Metadata automatically

Feel free to mail me for questions. I hope this is useful for someone, as it took me about a year of my free time to get this thing together. You can see it in action at:

Here is the CAKE PHP standard README:


CakePHP is a rapid development framework for PHP which uses commonly known design patterns like Active Record, Association Data Mapping, Front Controller and MVC. Our primary goal is to provide a structured framework that enables PHP users at all levels to rapidly develop robust web applications, without any loss to flexibility.
